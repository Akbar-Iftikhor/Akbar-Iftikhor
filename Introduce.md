# My Project data analyst 
## Project Objective 
This project is what I have undertaken to practice solving problems in various cases. It involves data analysis results using Python, Tableau, and Excel. In the next project, I aim to apply AI in data analysis.

# Python
## Case study: 
As a data analyst, the Metropolitan Police asked you to analyse antisocial behaviour in the London area from 01/08/2023 to 31/08/2024. The dataset “MPS_Antisocial_Behaviour.csv” should be processed and analysed using Python Tools (the dataset is attached to this file below and can also be found in the Assessment folder).
ASB is defined as “Behaviour by a person which causes or is likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress to one or more other persons, not of the same household as the person.” (Antisocial Behaviour Act 2003 & Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 2011). The MPS classifies ASB under 13 headings and qualifies incidents as “Personal”, “Nuisance”, and “Environmental” in line with the National Standard for Incident Recording (NSIR).

# Tableau
## Case Study :
As a data scientist, you participated in the “Mental Health at Work” research project. As a part of the project, you have to analyse the mental health records of five thousand remote employees. The dataset “Mental health.csv” examines the impact of remote work on mental health, gathering responses from individuals across various demographics. It includes key metrics such as job satisfaction, anxiety levels, and work-life balance.
